⏺ Project Understanding

  This is a Clinical Notes Summarizer - a healthcare AI solution that
  transforms complex medical summaries into patient-friendly "fridge
  magnet" summaries. The core innovation is a hybrid structured + AI 
  approach that ensures safety while improving clarity.

  Key Principles:

  - Safety First: Never AI-summarize critical medical data (medications,
  labs, vitals)
  - Hybrid Processing: Preserve exact structured data, enhance only
  narrative clarity
  - Patient-Centered: Transform incomprehensible medical jargon into
  readable format
  - Healthcare Compliance: HIPAA, FHIR R4, no PHI storage

  Technical Stack:

  - Backend: Python 3.9+ with FastAPI
  - AI/ML: Hugging Face Transformers (BART model)
  - Data: FHIR-compatible JSON
  - Testing: pytest with TDD approach
  - Frontend: Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  - Deployment: Docker

  Step-by-Step Agentic Orchestration

  Based on the agent roles, here's the orchestrated development approach:

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Product Owner: Define core user stories and acceptance criteria     
     ☐ Product Owner: Specify safety requirements and data preservation
       rules
     ☐ SWE: Set up TDD test framework and safety validation tests
     ☐ SWE: Implement hybrid clinical processor with structured data
       extraction
     ☐ SWE: Build AI narrative enhancement module (BART integration)
     ☐ SWE: Create FastAPI endpoints with FHIR compatibility
     ☐ SWE: Develop patient-friendly output formatter ('fridge magnet'
       format)
     ☐ Product Owner: Validate output against patient comprehension
       requirements
     ☐ SWE: Build simple web interface for testing and demonstration
     ☐ SWE: Create Docker deployment with health checks

⏺ Orchestrated Development Flow:

  Phase 1: Requirements & Safety (Product Owner)
  1. Define user stories from patient/caregiver/provider perspectives
  2. Establish acceptance criteria ensuring clinical accuracy
  3. Specify what data must be preserved exactly vs. AI-enhanced

  Phase 2: Core Architecture (SWE)
  3. Set up TDD framework with healthcare-specific safety tests
  4. Build HybridClinicalProcessor with clear data separation
  5. Implement structured data extraction (medications, labs, vitals)

  Phase 3: AI Integration (SWE)
  5. Integrate BART model for narrative enhancement only
  6. Create FastAPI endpoints with FHIR R4 compliance
  7. Build "fridge magnet" formatter for patient-friendly output

  Phase 4: Validation & Interface (Both)
  8. Product Owner validates against patient comprehension
  9. SWE builds simple web interface for testing
  10. SWE creates Docker deployment with health monitoring

  Critical Success Factors:

  - Zero tolerance for medication/dosage errors
  - >90% preservation of critical clinical information
  - <5 second processing time
  - 50% reduction in reading grade level for explanations
  - FHIR R4 compliance for EHR integration

  The agentic approach ensures domain expertise (Product Owner) drives
  requirements while technical expertise (SWE) implements with healthcare
  safety as the paramount concern.

> Now improve the swe.md, should I split the code reviewer and tester into 
  its own sub-agent?

⏺ Let me first read the current swe.md file completely to understand what
  needs improvement, then I'll provide recommendations on whether to split
  roles.

⏺ Read(agents/swe.md)
  ⎿  Read 67 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The current swe.md is incomplete and needs significant enhancement. Based
   on the healthcare context and TDD approach, I recommend keeping the 
  roles unified for this project because:

  1. Healthcare Safety: Quality assurance is inseparable from development
  in medical software
  2. TDD Approach: Testing and development are tightly coupled in the
  red-green-refactor cycle
  3. Small Team Efficiency: Better coordination when one person handles the
   full development cycle
  4. Domain Complexity: Healthcare-specific testing requires deep technical
   understanding

       457 +  1. **Complete architecture** with concrete code examples
       458 +  2. **Healthcare-specific testing strategy** with safety focus
       459 +  3. **Comprehensive error handling** for medical software
       460 +  4. **Privacy and security patterns** for PHI protection
       461 +  5. **Development workflow** optimized for healthcare

       462 +  6. **Code quality standards** specific to medical software
       463 +  
       464 +  The unified role approach works best here because the

⏺ Recommendation: Keep Unified SWE Role

  I recommend NOT splitting the code reviewer/tester into separate
  sub-agents for this healthcare project. Here's why:

  Why Unified Approach Works Better:

  1. Healthcare Safety Integration: In medical software, testing and
  quality assurance are inseparable from development. The person writing
  the code needs to understand the healthcare implications of every test
  case.
  2. Domain Expertise Required: Healthcare-specific testing requires deep
  understanding of:
    - FHIR standards and medical terminology
    - Clinical workflows and patient safety requirements
    - PHI protection and regulatory compliance
    - Medical data validation patterns
  3. TDD Methodology: The red-green-refactor cycle works best when one
  person owns the full loop, especially for safety-critical healthcare
  scenarios.
  4. Efficient Communication: No handoff overhead between development and
  testing phases, which is crucial for the iterative safety validation
  required in healthcare.

  Enhanced SWE Agent Now Includes:

  Complete Architecture Examples:
  - HybridClinicalProcessor for safe data separation
  - FHIRDataProcessor for standards compliance
  - AINarrativeEnhancer for patient-friendly language
  - PatientSummaryFormatter for "fridge magnet" layout

  Healthcare-Specific Testing Strategy:
  - HealthcareSafetyTester for critical data preservation
  - ClinicalScenarioTester for real-world medical cases
  - PerformanceTester for <5 second processing requirements

  Safety-First Development Patterns:
  - PHI protection with safe logging
  - Input sanitization preserving medical accuracy
  - Comprehensive error handling for medical software
  - Type safety with Pydantic medical data models

  Quality Assurance Integration:
  - Healthcare-specific code review checklist
  - Continuous integration with safety-focused pipeline
  - Documentation standards explaining medical decisions

  The enhanced SWE agent now provides a complete blueprint for building
  healthcare-compliant software while maintaining the tight integration
  between development, testing, and quality assurance that's essential for
  patient safety.

> /agent create product-owner "Use the persona defined in 
  agents/product-owner.md as your role. You are a healthcare Product Owner 
  specializing in clinical workflows, patient safety, and EHR integration."

⏺ Task(Create product-owner agent)
  ⎿  Initializing…
  ⎿  Error: Unknown command: /agent. Available commands: /init, 
     /pr-comments, /review

⏺ The /agent create command is not available. The agent personas you've
  defined in the agents/ folder are documentation that guide development
  approach rather than executable agents.

  However, I can help you work with the Product Owner persona by:

  1. Using the Product Owner mindset when defining requirements, user
  stories, and acceptance criteria based on the enhanced product-owner.md
  file
  2. Following the SWE approach when implementing code based on the
  enhanced swe.md file
  3. Switching context between roles as needed during development

  Would you like me to:
  - Start working as the Product Owner to define the core user stories and
  requirements?
  - Begin the SWE implementation based on the TDD approach outlined?
  - Set up the initial project structure following the technical
  specifications?

  The agent files serve as comprehensive role definitions that I can
  reference and embody during our development process.

> /agents 
  ⎿  Agent changes:
     Created agent: healthcare-product-owner
     Created agent: healthcare-swe

> how do I use the agents we just created?

⏺ You can use the agents in several ways:

  Using the Healthcare Agents

  1. Direct Agent Invocation

  Use the Task tool to invoke specific agents:

  Task(description="Define user stories", prompt="Create user stories for
  medication summary feature", subagent_type="healthcare-product-owner")

  Task(description="Implement API endpoint", prompt="Build FastAPI endpoint
   for FHIR document processing", subagent_type="healthcare-swe")

  2. When I Should Use Each Agent

  Healthcare Product Owner (healthcare-product-owner):
  - Defining requirements and user stories
  - Creating acceptance criteria with safety considerations
  - Validating features against patient comprehension
  - Planning EHR integration strategies
  - Prioritizing features based on clinical impact

  Healthcare SWE (healthcare-swe):
  - Implementing TDD workflows for medical software
  - Building FastAPI endpoints with FHIR compliance
  - Integrating AI/ML models safely for medical data
  - Writing healthcare-specific tests and validations
  - Ensuring PHI protection and regulatory compliance

  3. Workflow Example

  I can orchestrate both agents for you:

  1. Requirements Phase: Use healthcare-product-owner to define user
  stories
  2. Implementation Phase: Use healthcare-swe to build features with TDD
  3. Validation Phase: Use healthcare-product-owner to validate against
  clinical needs

  Would you like me to start by using the healthcare-product-owner agent to
   define the core user stories for the clinical notes summarizer, or would
   you prefer to begin with the healthcare-swe agent to set up the
  technical foundation?

> Task(description="Define user stories", prompt="Create user stories for 
  medication summary feature",
    subagent_type="healthcare-product-owner")

⏺ healthcare-product-owner(Define user stories)
  ⎿  Done (5 tool uses · 18.6k tokens · 58.8s)                             

⏺ The healthcare-product-owner agent has created comprehensive user stories
   for the medication summary feature. These stories follow the hybrid
  structured + AI approach by preserving critical medication data exactly
  while enhancing patient comprehension.

  Key highlights from the user stories:

  1. Safety-First Approach: Zero tolerance for medication errors with exact
   preservation of dosages, frequencies, and instructions
  2. Patient-Centered Design: Stories focused on different user types
  (patients, caregivers, providers) with specific accessibility needs
  3. "Fridge Magnet" Format: Scannable, mobile-responsive design for daily
  medication management
  4. EHR Integration Ready: FHIR R4 compatibility and provider workflow
  integration
  5. Comprehensive Edge Cases: Handling incomplete data, multiple
  languages, and error scenarios

  The stories include specific, measurable acceptance criteria that align
  with the project's success metrics (>90% data preservation, 6th-8th grade
   reading level, <5 second processing).

  Would you like me to now use the healthcare-swe agent to start
  implementing the TDD framework and core architecture for these medication
   summary features?

> yes

⏺ healthcare-swe(Implement TDD framework)
  ⎿  Done (72 tool uses · 86.5k tokens · 1h 13m 29.5s)                     

⏺ Excellent! The healthcare-swe agent has successfully implemented a
  comprehensive TDD framework and core architecture. Here's what was
  accomplished:

  ✅ Production-Ready Foundation Delivered

  38/38 Tests Passing - Complete TDD implementation with zero failures

  Critical Safety Features Implemented:

  - Zero tolerance medication errors: Names, dosages, frequencies preserved
   exactly
  - AI processing prohibition: Critical medical data never touches AI
  models
  - Comprehensive validation: Input → Processing → Output validation chain
  - FHIR R4 compliance: Healthcare interoperability standards maintained

  Core Architecture Components:

  1. Pydantic Models with strict healthcare validation
  2. FHIR Medication Parser with exact data preservation
  3. Hybrid Clinical Processor enforcing the structured + AI approach
  4. Safety Testing Suite with healthcare-specific validators

  Key Safety Guarantees:

  - Medication data preserved with cryptographic integrity hashes
  - Required healthcare disclaimers automatically added
  - Processing metadata tracked for audit trails
  - Zero AI processing of life-critical information

  This foundation perfectly supports the medication summary user stories
  while maintaining the hybrid approach: preserve exactly (medications,
  labs, vitals) and prepare for AI enhancement (narratives, explanations).

  Next steps you could consider:
  1. Add FastAPI endpoints for the clinical processor
  2. Implement the AI narrative enhancer for non-critical content
  3. Build the patient-friendly formatter for "fridge magnet" summaries
  4. Create the web interface for testing and demonstration

  Would you like me to continue with any of these next phases, or would you
   prefer to review the implemented code first?

  implementation

  2. Detailed Healthcare Product Owner

  - Domain Expertise: EHR systems, regulatory knowledge, data standards
  - Key Deliverables: User stories, prioritization framework, risk
  management
  - Clinical Focus: Patient experience and health literacy

  3. Comprehensive Healthcare SWE

  - Technical Expertise: Python stack, FHIR standards, AI/ML integration
  - Implementation Areas: Hybrid processor, safety testing, security
  patterns
  - Code Quality Standards: Healthcare-specific review checklist, error
  handling

  4. Enhanced Specialization Details

  - Product Owner: Clinical workflows, patient safety, EHR integration
  planning
  - SWE: TDD with healthcare scenarios, PHI protection, medical data
  validation
  - Collaboration: Clear delineation of roles and responsibilities

  The updated section now provides a complete picture of how the
  specialized sub-agents work together, showcasing:

  - Domain-specific expertise in healthcare software
