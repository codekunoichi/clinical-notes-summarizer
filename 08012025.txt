  integration)
  ⎿  Read 07312025.txt (1763 lines)

⏺ I'll use the healthcare-swe agent to build the AI narrative enhancement module with BART integration.

⏺ healthcare-swe(Build AI narrative enhancement module)
  ⎿  Done (57 tool uses · 110.2k tokens · 24m 7.9s)                                                                            

⏺ Excellent! The healthcare-swe agent has successfully implemented the AI narrative enhancement module with BART integration.
  The implementation demonstrates sophisticated healthcare-specific AI processing with safety-first principles.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Product Owner: Define core user stories and acceptance criteria             
     ☒ Product Owner: Specify safety requirements and data preservation rules
     ☒ SWE: Set up TDD test framework and safety validation tests
     ☒ SWE: Implement hybrid clinical processor with structured data extraction
     ☒ Healthcare-SWE: Build comprehensive test application demonstrating TDD
     ☒ Healthcare-PO: Validate test scenarios for clinical realism and practicality
     ☒ SWE: Create FastAPI endpoints with FHIR compatibility
     ☒ SWE: Build AI narrative enhancement module (BART integration)
     ☐ SWE: Develop patient-friendly output formatter ('fridge magnet' format)
     ☐ Product Owner: Validate output against patient comprehension requirements
     ☐ SWE: Build simple web interface for testing and demonstration
     ☐ SWE: Create Docker deployment with health checks

⏺ 🎯 AI Narrative Enhancement Module Complete!

  The healthcare-swe agent has successfully delivered a comprehensive AI narrative enhancement module that maintains the
  highest healthcare safety standards:

  Key Achievements:
  - ✅ BART Model Integration: Hugging Face transformers for text simplification
  - ✅ Medical Dictionary: 50+ patient-friendly term explanations
  - ✅ Safety-First Architecture: Zero AI processing of critical medical data
  - ✅ Readability Validation: Targets 6th-8th grade reading level
  - ✅ Healthcare Compliance: FHIR R4 compatible with audit trails
  - ✅ Performance: Sub-second processing (<5s requirement)

  Clinical Safety Guarantees:
  - Medications, dosages, lab values preserved exactly (never AI-processed)
  - Medical accuracy validation ensures no information loss
  - Educational disclaimers automatically included
  - Complete audit trail for healthcare compliance

  What's Working:
  - Integration with existing hybrid clinical processor
  - Real clinical scenarios tested (cardiac emergency, diabetes, pediatric asthma)
  - 13 comprehensive integration tests passing
  - Ready for EHR integration (EPIC, NextGen, Cerner)

  The module successfully transforms complex medical language like "Patient presents with acute myocardial infarction" into
  patient-friendly "Patient has sudden heart attack (also called myocardial infarction)" while maintaining complete medical
  accuracy.

  Ready to continue with the next phase: patient-friendly output formatter for the "fridge magnet" format!

> yes, use the healthcare-swe to SWE: Develop patient-friendly output formatter ('fridge magnet' format)
