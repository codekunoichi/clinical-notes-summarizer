# Clinical Notes Summarizer

## Project Overview

A healthcare AI solution that transforms incomprehensible medical summaries into patient-friendly "fridge magnet" summaries using a **hybrid structured + AI approach**. This addresses the real problem where patients can't understand their own medical information.

### üè• The Problem
- Patients receive complex medical summaries filled with jargon
- Critical medication information is buried in technical language
- Healthcare literacy barriers prevent proper self-care
- Patients struggle to follow treatment plans they can't understand

### üí° The Solution
**Hybrid Structured + AI Processing:**
- **PRESERVE EXACTLY**: Medications, dosages, lab values, appointments (zero AI modification)
- **AI-ENHANCE**: Narrative explanations, procedure descriptions, care instructions
- **"Fridge Magnet" Format**: Scannable, mobile-friendly, printable summaries

## üî¨ Development Approach: Healthcare TDD

### Test-Driven Development with Clinical Safety

1. **Red**: Write failing tests based on clinical requirements
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass safety tests  
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining healthcare compliance
4. **Validate**: Test with real clinical scenarios

### Current Test Results
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Results: 92/99 tests passing
# ‚úÖ Medication safety tests: 100% pass rate
# ‚úÖ Emergency protocols: Clinically validated
# ‚úÖ FHIR compliance: R4 standard adherence
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Hybrid Processing Engine
```python
class HybridClinicalProcessor:
    """
    Core processor implementing hybrid structured + AI approach
    - Preserves exact: medications, labs, vitals, appointments
    - AI-enhances: narratives, explanations, instructions
    """
    
    def process_clinical_note(self, fhir_data: dict) -> PatientSummary:
        # Extract structured data (no AI processing)
        structured = self._extract_structured_data(fhir_data)
        
        # Extract narratives for AI enhancement
        narratives = self._extract_narrative_sections(fhir_data)
        
        # Apply AI only to narrative sections
        enhanced_narratives = self._enhance_narratives(narratives)
        
        # Combine for patient-friendly output
        return self._format_patient_summary(structured, enhanced_narratives)
```

### Safety-First Data Models
```python
class MedicationRequest(BaseModel):
    """FHIR-compliant medication with zero-tolerance validation"""
    medication_name: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    dosage_amount: str = Field(..., regex=r'^[\d\.]+ \w+$')
    frequency: MedicationFrequency
    
    @validator('medication_name')
    def preserve_exact_name(cls, v):
        # Critical: medication names must never be modified
        return v.strip()
```

## üß™ Clinical Test Scenarios

Our comprehensive test suite covers real-world healthcare scenarios:

### Diabetes Management
```python
def test_complex_insulin_regimen_processing():
    """Test realistic diabetes medication regimen"""
    # Basal-bolus insulin with carb ratios and sliding scale
    # Validates: exact dosing preservation, timing instructions
```

### Emergency Protocols  
```python
def test_epipen_adult_emergency_protocol():
    """Test anaphylaxis emergency protocol"""
    # EpiPen 0.3mg administration, call 911, follow-up care
    # Validates: life-critical instruction preservation
```

### Medication Interactions
```python
def test_warfarin_antibiotic_interaction_scenario():
    """Test dangerous drug interaction detection"""
    # Warfarin + azithromycin bleeding risk
    # Validates: safety alert generation, clinical decision support
```
