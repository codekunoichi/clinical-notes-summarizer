# Clinical Notes Summarizer

## Project Overview

A healthcare AI solution that transforms incomprehensible medical summaries into patient-friendly "fridge magnet" summaries using a **hybrid structured + AI approach**. This addresses the real problem where patients can't understand their own medical information.

### 🏥 The Problem
- Patients receive complex medical summaries filled with jargon
- Critical medication information is buried in technical language
- Healthcare literacy barriers prevent proper self-care
- Patients struggle to follow treatment plans they can't understand

### 💡 The Solution
**Hybrid Structured + AI Processing:**
- **PRESERVE EXACTLY**: Medications, dosages, lab values, appointments (zero AI modification)
- **AI-ENHANCE**: Narrative explanations, procedure descriptions, care instructions
- **"Fridge Magnet" Format**: Scannable, mobile-friendly, printable summaries

3. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining healthcare compliance
4. **Validate**: Test with real clinical scenarios

### Current Test Results
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Results: 92/99 tests passing
# ✅ Medication safety tests: 100% pass rate
# ✅ Emergency protocols: Clinically validated
# ✅ FHIR compliance: R4 standard adherence
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Hybrid Processing Engine
```python
class HybridClinicalProcessor:
    """
    Core processor implementing hybrid structured + AI approach
    - Preserves exact: medications, labs, vitals, appointments
    - AI-enhances: narratives, explanations, instructions
    """
    
    def process_clinical_note(self, fhir_data: dict) -> PatientSummary:
        # Extract structured data (no AI processing)
        structured = self._extract_structured_data(fhir_data)
        
        # Extract narratives for AI enhancement
        narratives = self._extract_narrative_sections(fhir_data)
        
        # Apply AI only to narrative sections
        enhanced_narratives = self._enhance_narratives(narratives)
        
        # Combine for patient-friendly output
        return self._format_patient_summary(structured, enhanced_narratives)
```

### Safety-First Data Models
```python
class MedicationRequest(BaseModel):
    """FHIR-compliant medication with zero-tolerance validation"""
    medication_name: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    dosage_amount: str = Field(..., regex=r'^[\d\.]+ \w+$')
    frequency: MedicationFrequency
    
    @validator('medication_name')
    def preserve_exact_name(cls, v):
        # Critical: medication names must never be modified
        return v.strip()
```

## 🧪 Clinical Test Scenarios
